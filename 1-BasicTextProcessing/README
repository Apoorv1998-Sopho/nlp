Else Everyone:
This folder contains some basic text proccessing stuff that has been covered in the first week of our course NLP. Will try to run som e notebooks to get comfy. 

Basic things covered include:


    Tokenization
    Stemming
    Spell Correction

Take away points:

1. Some languages work really good if we use greedy algorithms (like Chinese) as they usually have many words that are formed using conjuction of 2 or more words. Whereas in the case of English these 'greedy' algorithms don't seem to provide that much help.
2. Punctuations are also tockenized to be declared as a token in itself, seems that they should not be.
3. What happens when we have something like Out and out, do we put them is same type or not. I think not.
4.
